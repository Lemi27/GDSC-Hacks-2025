# Campus Connect

**GDSC Hacks 2025 Submission**

Campus Connect is a student-centered roommate and friend-matching platform that helps university students find like-minded peers to live with. Whether it's aligning on cleanliness, budgets, or daily habits ‚Äî we help make student housing more intentional and stress-free.

## üöÄ Inspiration

Student housing is more than just securing a room ‚Äî it's about building a home with the *right people*. The individuals we live with directly affect our productivity, well-being, and academic success. **Campus Connect** was born from our desire to help students find not just roommates, but compatible communities that uplift and support their growth.

## üí° What It Does

Campus Connect matches students based on:
- Shared interests and goals  
- Daily routines and lifestyle preferences  
- Cleanliness and noise tolerance  
- Housing budget and location preferences  

By analyzing these traits, we help students form meaningful, harmonious living arrangements and connections.
